                                <h2><a>Shaders Practice Project In Unity</a></h2>
                                <p>Just wanted to log the progress of myself learning shaders in Unity. I am not experienced with art techniques or gfx very much.</p>
                                <br><p>Here is what I started with. I just used a free .fbx model on the Unity Asset Store.</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/step 1.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>As you can see, the models colors are very dull and just don't stand out well in the game. So I wanted to improve this.</p>
                                <p>I went ahead and experimented with Unitys URP. Here is the first product!</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/step 2.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>With these first changes, you can see I improved the blurryness of the model, as well as the very dull color! I was happy to see results. Next I wanted to see if I could make the model look more like an anime.</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/step 3.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>I added a small outline on the character model, and changed her skin tone a little bit, but I was not very happy with much on this version except her eyes. I did a great job on the eye textures!</p>
                                <p>At this point I had to learn shaders, or at least how to apply shaders. So I gave it a try: </p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/step 4.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>What an improvement since the start! The character now stands out even in a colorful world, and has a cool anime outline too! </p>
                                <p>I am not an artist, I am a programmer. So this is where my journey stops for now. I plan to apply this to my Unity MMORPG Project to really make it pop! Thanks for reading!</p>
