                                <h2><a>My First VR Game Solo - Cooking Simulator(Ongoing)</a></h2>
                                <h3>Here are some snapshots from my game:</h3>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/vr img 1.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <br>
                                <p>This first screenshot is taken in the middle of the first tutorial level. You can see customers have icons over their head, which indicate what they want. A drink socket (green wine glass) will appear when they want a drink with their food.</p>
                                <p>You can get precise information on what the customers are asking for on each level by looking at the flatscreen TV in the kitchen as shown below:</p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/vr img 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>The kitchen setup allows for cooking of three different types of foods on this level. Players are tasked with cooking ham, noodle soups, and a single pizza in this round. Don't forget the drinks! <br>My idea is to have this
                                    game be a test of managing your time, so in most levels outside of this tutorial level the player will be racing against the clock to deliver all of the food needed. This definitely requires both hands!<br>Here is another snapshot:
                                </p>
                                <a class="image fit"><img src="images/vr img 4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>Everything in the kitchen will be interactable in this game. As you can see, currently you need to use both the oven, and the refrigerator to accomplish your tasks. There is also a kitchen door that needs to be either opened with your hand or
                                    opened with pushing an object you are holding against the door.
                                </p>
                                <h2>There are some secret features being worked on, but you'll have to wait and see! :)</h2>
                                <p>Thank you for checking out my game, and soon there will be a video down below you can watch!</p>
